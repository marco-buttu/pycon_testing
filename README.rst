Lessons Learned About Testing And TDD
=====================================
One day our software will go in production, and so shortly we will pay 
dearly for our youthful mistakes. Without regression tests, 
we will be in deep trouble. If we have regression tests, but we did not
have performed TDD, we should probably increase the effort in bug fixing and
maintenance, since we do not have enough code coverage and our tests
come out complex.

By retracing the author youthful mistakes, we will see a
complete development workflow, from the user story to the low-level
tests, in order to highlight the differences between functional, integration
and unit tests, the best practices, and the lessons learned by the author
during the development of the `Sardinia Radio Telescope
