Lessons Learned About Testing And TDD
=====================================
One day our software will go in production, and shortly we will pay 
dearly for our youthful mistakes. Without regression tests, 
we will be in deep trouble. If we have regression test, but we did not
perform TDD, probably we should increase the effort in bug fixing and
maintenance, because both we do not have enough code coverage and our tests
come out complex.

After retracing the author youthful mistakes, we will see a
a complete development workflow, from the user story to the low-level
tests, in order to highlight the differences between functional, integration
and unit tests, the best practices and the lessons learned by the author
during the development of `Sardinia Radio Telescope
